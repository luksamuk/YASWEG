YASWEG - Yet Another Static Website Generator
=============================================

There is nothing serious NOR anything to be maintained here.
I do not intend to take this to the ends of the world. We good? Good.

YASWEG is a static website generator, as the title says.
It implements a simple Scheme API foi doing so, and is designed to run on GNU Guile.
YASWEG will then write a static HTML file from the information provided.
The goal is to build such simple thing, for study purposes.

Usage
-----
YASWEG is built atop GNU Guile, so you might as well just compile YASWEG once, then import the `(yasweg generator)` module, and you're good to go.

Inside is a single test example, being used to help create the project.
